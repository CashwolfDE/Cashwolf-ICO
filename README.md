# Cashwolf-ICO
The Cashwolf repository of used Contracts during Crowdsale. All future projects will also available here.

19.03.2018 - We added our Token creation and Crowdsale Smart Contract Wolf.sol

Wolf is a mintable ERC20 Token.

We have implemented a revoke function to comply with German law and build trust. Anyone who buys Wolf can cancel his purchase within 14 days without giving a reason and gets his ETH back. The purchased wolves are then burned in this case. (Check Line 422)
